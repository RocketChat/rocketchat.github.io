We tried out many chat tools, but none of them seemed to please the team. Until Rocket.Chat! Rocket was quickly deployed and embraced. We didn't find any major complications. It is easy to use, and it feels like we're all in the same room. It enabled us to allow home office, which made the team so happy. Because its mobile app, we can also be productive from anywhere.”
