Let's check some criteria to help you choose the right solution!

### PRICING

For sure the first main impact will be in pricing since Slack is more expensive than HipChat. For the video conference feature, for example, the former could roughly charge $8 per user on a monthly basis plan (includes this feature) while Hipchat´s users would be charged $2

By contrast, this solution costs our Rocket.Chat clients $3 per person per month.The great news? This price includes other features like high scalability cluster, file storage migrate tool, and even more. Check the rest of [Rocket.Chat features](https://rocket.chat/pricing).

### ON PREMISE VS CLOUD VERSION

Slack offers the cloud version only. However, Hipchat users would have available the on prem version. The latter version is preferred by some enterprises and organizations for several reasons such as security, ease, data protection and so on. Luckily, Rocket.Chat opts for both versions, you can freely choose the infrastructure that fits your needs and your own security protocols.

### SECURITY

Completely related to the last point, there are organizations who swear by on prem softwares since it enables the set up of their own security protocols which is an additional layer of security. On cloud versions, this customization is not possible.

### WHAT IS THE BEST ALTERNATIVE?

You will find plenty of options in the market. This is the ideal moment to talk even further about one of the best fully open source options in the market: Rocket.Chat!

Rocket.Chat technology can run on-premises or on cloud, and fully integrate all Atlassian's products (Jira, Confluence, Trello, Service Desk and so on)

## WHAT MAKES ROCKET CHAT DIFFERENT FROM OTHER PLATFORMS?

Organizations count with a plethora of communication and collaboration tools to deal with stakeholders. However, it is difficult for large groups to collaborate with different entities of their ecosystem, keep a high security level and keep track of tasks and conversations. Furthermore, the tools available in the market are not flexible enough and most of the time don't connect with other providers.

## FLEXIBILITY AND AGILITY

Rocket.Chat´s technology allows more than 1000k integrations. From bots, to facebook messenger  whatsapp or slack, the options are almost unlimited. Furthermore, its short release cycle does not only allow an agile usability but also scalability whether you opt for a self managed or saas version

### INTERCONNECTIVITY

Interconnectivity with the federation is a unique feature that enables the communication with other Rocket.Chat servers. Find and exchange messages and files unlimitedly.

### SAFE FOR YOUR DATA

We care about the security of your information. We count with end to end encryption for all the communication taking place on our platform. Additionally, you can customize  and add more layers of security in our self- managed version.

## IS THE MIGRATION FROM HIPCHAT TO ROCKET.CHAT SIMPLE?

The migration process is simple; the first part is to export the data from the [Hipchat instance](https://confluence.atlassian.com/hc/exporting-and-importing-your-hipchat-data-688882302.html).

With the exported file at hand, now it's Rocket.Chat's turn:

On the Administration panel, open the Import section and click on the Start button under the Hipchat section to start the import process.

Yes, that's it!

Rocket.Chat also has integrations with the Atlassian suite products: Bitbucket, Confluence and Jira, so you can keep your DevOps setup when moving over.

These reasons make Rocket.Chat´s your perfect ally to improve the communication inside your organization and also with your clients. Stop losing potential leads because of a wrong communication. [Let's work together](https://rocket.chat/contact).
