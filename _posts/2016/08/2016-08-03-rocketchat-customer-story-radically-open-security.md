## Instant communication in a radically new business model

Radically Open Security (RSO) is the world's first not-for-profit computer security company. With 90 percent of profits going to a charity that supports an open internet, the founders couldn't be more serious about the principle of an open information society.

When this globally distributed organization started looking for a secure solution for their communication needs, the only choice was an open source IM platform, which is how they discovered Rocket.Chat.

## Why give 90 percent of your profits to charity?

Co-founder John Sinteur says the company is able to give away most of its profits through an innovative business model and the excellent service RSO provides to its customers.

The company uses a Dutch "Fiscaal Fondswervende Instelling" (Fiscal Fundraising Institution) to provide a commercial front end that sends 90 percent of the organization's profits tax-free to a back end foundation (Stichting NLnet) that has supported open source, Internet research and digital rights organizations for almost 20 years.

## "How could we possibly use anything _but_ open source ourselves?"

Given their commitment to an open internet, it was important to ROS to find a communication platform that adhered to the same principles.

ROS needed a solution that was secure, scalable and could easily integrate both with tools the company used frequently - like GitLab, Kanboard and Hubot - and those that ROS were writing in-house.

Rocket.Chat ticked all these boxes and the team hasn't looked back: "We simply integrate Rocket.Chat with whatever we need at the time we're doing a project."

## Announcing the Live PenText demo

Rocket.Chat is now an integral part of ROS's globally distributed workplace and projects, including PenText, a fully open-sourced XML-based pentest document automation system and a OWASP project that will soon be made public.

John explains: "We're about to give a demo of the automation framework that supports the entire pentesting lifecycle: from the initial inquiry, through pen test scoping, quotations, pentesting, and reporting, through the final invoice. Rocket Chat is part of that."

## "RocketChat is one of the most active and responsive dev teams I've seen in a loooooong time."

Given the confidential nature of ROS's client data the company self-hosts Rocket.Chat. Whenever the team do see the potential for a security leak they create an issue in for the Rocket.Chat team in GitHub.

Since adopting Rocket.Chat, John says that it is easier to collaborate and that there's been an uptick in turnaround time for projects.

Are there any features he would like to request? He's way ahead of us, answering: "None that aren't already a GitHub issue!"
