This week, we're launching our new websiteâ€”just in time for our one-year anniversary! We've been working on it over the past few weeks and we'd love for you to give it a test drive and share your feedback.

We've also launched a new documentation system that <a href="https://rocket.chat/docs/contributing/" target="_blank">allows direct contributions</a>. With the new system you can locally stage and test your contributions and then push them to the <a href="https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat.Docs" target="_blank">Rocket.Chat docs repository</a>.

Some new features you might have already seen, or will see soon include:

*   Live chat helpdesk
*   Multi-platform applications
*   Group video chat integration
*   LDAP authentication
*   REST APIs
*   File sharing

Finally, we have been working on some really exciting projects with our community.

We have been working with Arizona State University, which has been ranked as the most innovative in the USA, to create a communication platform for their 90,000 sutdents. The project is scheduled to go live this fall.

Rocket.Chat has also been collaborating with the Ural Federal University on a system that links students and teaching staff via mobile and web applications. There are plans to evolve the system in a national massive open online course (MOOC) that brings together courses from the best universities in Russia.

Finally, we have been working on a pilot social networking experiment with researchers from the universities of Stanford, Columbia, Oxford and Occoni. The experiment, which launches this fall, aims to connect entrepreneurs in Ghana, Uganda and Kenya through Rocket.Chat.
