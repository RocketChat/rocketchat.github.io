This week, just in time for our one-year anniversary, we're launching a new website! We've been working on it for the last few weeks, and we'd love you to have a poke around, give it a test drive and share feedback on your experience. We're always ready to tweak things if it makes your experience better!

We've also just launched a brand new documentation system that [allows direct contributions](https://rocket.chat/docs/contributing/). You can stage and test your contributions locally and then push it to our [Docs Repository](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat.Docs). After you have a chance to try it, feel free to let us know what you think.

Of course, the core team is always frantically coding features and fixing bugs. Some of the major features you might have seen, or will soon see include:

*   Live chat helpdesk
*   Multi-platform applications
*   Group video chat integration
*   LDAP authentication
*   REST APIs
*   File sharing

Finally, we've been working on some really exciting projects with our community lately. Let me share a bit of the behind-the-scenes stuff so you can see what kinds of things we're up to these days.

With the Arizona State University, ranked the most innovative university in the USA, we are collaborating on a system enabling over 90,000 students to communicate and collaborate with one another, their advisers, and success coaches; scheduled to go live for this fall.

With the Ural Federal University in Ekaterinburg, innovations leader in Russia, we are collaborating on a system that ties together their students and professors via mobile and web applications. The system will be further evolved into a national Massive Open Online Courses MOOC system combining the courses of the best universities in Russia.

Assisting researchers from Stanford, Columbia, Oxford, and Occoni universities, a pilot social networking experiment will launch this fall deploying Rocket.Chat to enable 5000 Sub-Saharan African Entrepeneurs in major cities of Ghana, Uganda, and Kenya to collaborate, hone, and collaborate on business ideas and opportunities via their mobile phones.

Also check out our recent posts about projects with [Lisk](http://rocket.chat/blog/rocketchat-helps-lisk-connect-with-their-community) and [Southeastern Louisiana University](http://rocket.chat/blog/rocketchat-accelerates-collaboration-at-southeastern-louisiana-university).
