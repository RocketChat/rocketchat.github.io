A message from Rocket.Chat’s CEO

Coronavirus is affecting workplaces worldwide. There is still much we don’t know about this epidemic, for how long it will last, how it will affect the population and the economy.  There are [numerous practices](https://rocket.chat/2020/03/10/covid/) that can help to contain the virus and prevent it from spreading, and at this time it's important that each individual put their social responsibility as a priority.

The epidemic itself was not something we could predict, but side actions, such as remote work, can help business to keep productive. Rocket.Chat is committed to improve [workstream collaboration](https://rocket.chat/team-collab) and [Omnichannel customer engagement](https://rocket.chat/customer-solutions). It is a great tool to [keep track of projects](https://rocket.chat/devops), discussions and continuous communication with stakeholders without losing [security](https://rocket.chat/security), flexibility, and scalability.

Rocket.Chat is currently one of the most accessible communication tools in the market and at this time of uncertainty, we are committed to supporting you and your team even further. From March 17th and beyond we will host webinars on how to work remotely with Rocket.Chat on a weekly basis.

If you need extra help, we are ready to talk:
- Reach out at Open.rocket.chat, #best-practices
- [contact@rocket.chat](mailto:contact@rocket.chat)

Additional best practice sources:
- [Rocket.Chat Guides](https://rocket.chat/docs/)
- [Join the Rocket.Chat Community](https://rocket.chat/community)

We are optimistic that this situation will be controlled and hopefully we can keep a fruitful relationship in the long term.
