As many of you know, Rocket.Chat turned two the other day -- Friday, May 26th marked the day we went live back in 2015\.  We fondly remember the excitement when, within a few hours, it went viral on Hacker News, Product Hunt and others, like it was yesterday. Your overwhelming enthusiasm took down our community server :)

Wow, how that time has flown! 

We wanted to take this opportunity to thank everyone for all the continued support, feedback and enthusiasm for our project. We really love this community and having it grow with all of you these past two years has been an incredible journey for us. We're excited just imagining where we could be by our third birthday! 

Join us in celebrating our community and please share pictures of you with your favorite Rocket.Chat swag. Here's a few of our own... 

[Here's a folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0ByJ455SMftOBWTIwa1NHWG1vVXM?usp=sharing) of one's we've collected so far

Share your picture by tagging #RocketChatSwag. Thanks, everyone!
