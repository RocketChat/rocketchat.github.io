We're excited to announce that seven keen coders will be taking part in the Google Summer of Code 2017 - four funded by Google and three funded by us!

Google did us the honor of choosing to fund four of our suggested projects for this year's [Summer of Code](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/). Usually first year organizations have one or two projects accepted, so we were really pleased that they were excited by so many of our ideas. In fact, we were so impressed by the applicants who put forward their proposals that we decided to fund three more ourselves!

We had 68 excellent proposals from elite students based around the world. Nine were shortlisted and interviewed by us. Seven of these outstanding university students will be working with Rocket.Chat over the summer beginning in early June (thru September). 

The first four projects in the list below are funded by Google, and the final three are funded by Rocket.Chat:

- **Creation of a PWA Client.** Student: _Naman Gupta._ Rocket.Chat mentors: _Karl Prieb, Guilherme Gazzo_
- **Rocket.Chat iOS SDK**. Student: _Lucas Woo_. Rocket.Chat mentors: _Rafael Kellermann Streit, Rodrigo Nascimento_
- **Integrated Personal Email Gateway**. Student: _Pradeep Kumar._ Rocket.Chat mentors: _Rodrigo Nascimento, Diego Sampaio_
- **E2E encryption with Signal Protocol**. Student: _Mrinal Dhar_. Rocket.Chat mentors: _Marcelo Schmidt, Marius Nepomuceno_
- **Automatic Channels**. Student: _Karan Batra_. Rocket.Chat mentors: _Mitar MilutinoviÄ‡, Rodrigo Nascimento_
- **Rocket.Chat Android SDK**. Student: _Sachin Shinde_. Rocket.Chat mentor: _Rafael Kellermann Streit_
- **Federation Server**. Student: _Manish Kakoti._ Rocket.Chat mentors: _Gabriel Engel, Sing Li, Matthew Hodgson_

We're looking forward to sharing our expertise on open source projects, and also learning from them too! Their Rocket.Chat mentors will be guiding them through open source coding, community engagement, and trending technical skills. The seven students will be paid and they will be a part of the open source community. Their project will be real, and benefiting the open source Rocket.Chat community throughout their summer term.

This is an unrivalled opportunity for the students to experience life as an open source coder. They will be enhancing their resumes with documented experience in a showcase startup company. It's also a chance for us to give something back to the tech community of the future. We can't wait to get started!
