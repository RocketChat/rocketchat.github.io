Hi everyone, A very quick follow-up on our "A round of drinks with Rocket.Chat"  meet-up in San Jose  yesterday evening: It was a resounding success!

Approximately 30 people turned out and we can happily report we've made quite a few new friends, had a chance to meet some long-time supporters, introduced a few of you to Rocket.Chat, and most importantly, we've all had a blast (sorry, bad pun... ;) ) amidst all the conference activities.

A special thank you to our venue, the [Continental Bar, Lounge, & Patio](http://thecontinentalbar.com/)! The ambience of the space proved perfect for this type of gathering - All in all, it was an amazing night and we thank everyone who took part in it.

Don't forget, we have [another Meet-Up coming up](https://www.meetup.com/Rocket-Chat-San-Francisco-Bay-Area/events/240073568/) on Wednesday, June 14th, at the Google Launchpad in San Francisco. Tell a few friends and hope to see you all there!
