We are happy to announce the release of the Rocket.Chat+ desktop app 2.9.0 for Windows, Linux and macOS. All new desktop apps are <a href="https://rocket.chat/download">available for download</a>.

The new apps feature improvements such as easier deployment for companies and better notifications.

Mac users will notice that a Services menu has been added and that they are able to answer messages directly from a notification alert.

We have fixed issues with duplicate notifications and the app window not opening for Windows users.

For those that deploy the apps to multiple users, we have added server default configuration file, where administrators can pre-define the list of servers for all users in the system.

In addition, we have added a _rocketchat://_ protocol handler, so now you can share server URLs with users and it will be added to their app server list once opened. This works for messages inside the Rocket.Chat+ app and for your website as well.

We admit that we have been neglecting the development of the Electron app, and so would like to apologize to our loyal community. With the recent growth in team numbers, we'll be able to focus on maintaining a steady development cycle to bring you more regular updates and releases.

Please see the <a href="https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat.Electron/releases/tag/2.9.0">release notes</a> for all improvements and bug fixes in this release.

Ubuntu users, we will have our desktop client snap updated shortly. For Fedora users, we are adding the .deb and .rpm into the official repository.
