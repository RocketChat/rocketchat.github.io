<a href="https://brave.com" target="_blank">Brave</a> is a free and open source web browser from Brendan Eich, Mozilla cofounder and the inventor of Javascript.

Brave leverages blockchain technology to restore control over web privacy to users. It completely blocks all trackers and elimates annoying targeted ads.

Instead, you can reward the websites you trust and want to support, via Brave Payments.

## Blockchain powered reward system

You can use the specially-created crytocurrency <a href="https://basicattentiontoken.org/" target="_blank">BasicAttentionToken</a> (BAT) to reward the websites and information providers you visit most frequently.

Rocket.Chat is an official Brave-verified publisher and you can receive BAT when you visit our servers via Brave.

## Tested with Rocket.Chat

Brave has been tested extensively and works extremely well with Rocket.Chat. Brave team members are valuable contributing members within the Rocket.Chat community.

## Crypto Token Grants

Brave recently gave users BAT grants so they could reward their favorite sites (the promotion is now over), but will do so again in the near futureâ€”so stay tuned for more!
