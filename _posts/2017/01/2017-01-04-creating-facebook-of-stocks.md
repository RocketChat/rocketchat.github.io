The wide availability of affordable electronic stock has democratized the field of investment and offered more people the opportunity to become an investor than ever before.

While this is fantastic news, it comes with own unique problems, a major one being the Lone Wolf Investor syndrome. Modern investors tend to work independently, trading alone in front of a computer. With no unified place to discuss strategies or risk management with other, investors often become prone to emotion. This can lead to a high chance of them losing their hard-earned money.

## The Lone Wolf Investor syndrome

While this is fantastic news, it also brings upon its own unique problems.  One major problem is the Lone Wolf Investor syndrome.  Modern investors tend to operate independently, trading alone and in isolation in front of a computer.    When trading in isolation, with no unified consistent place to discuss strategies or risk management with others, investors often become influenced by emotion.  This can lead to a high probability of losing their hard earned money. 

### Rocking the electronic trading world

Albert Frimpong, CTO of [https://techmeetstrader.com](https://techmeetstrader.com)  (San Diego), is committed to create the "Facebook of stocks" - bringing together and empowering all the lone wolf investors in this world - to build a unified and consistent investment community experience:   the TechMeetsTrader community. 

TechMeetsTrader is: 

- A community where investors can fully discuss what they're trading, why, and how.  
- A community where investors can maximize their success by collaborating with and learning from one another.    
- A community where investors can participate in what matters most to them, whether its stocks or options investing, by creating and joining groups.    

Ultimately, TechMeetsTrader will streamline the process of going from idea to profit - by facilitating and automating strategic trade workflows.  

## Rocket.Chat in its heart and soul

The TechMeetsTrader team, Albert and five incredibly talented developers, have been working around the clock with the Rocket.Chat's core team during 2016 to create this unique investment community platform.  Albert says:  "We loved the interactions with the Rocket.Chat team and community. It seemed as if everything we needed was already in motion from the community. For example, at one point channels and direct messages were private to the point where the Giphy integration would only work in public channels. I looked through the Rocket.Chat issues for 10 minutes and BAM... there's a pull request to open the channels for bots to be able to post." Most core features of Rocket.Chat are important to the TechMeetsTrader platform,  Albert says, but the ability to create group chats is absolutely pivotal. 

 _"Groups is where true collaboration happens for everyone using TechMeetsTrader."_ 

## Launching early 2017

The journey has been super smooth thus far for TechMeetTraders.   Their platform was built on React, NodeJS, MongoDB, & Neo4J - highly compatible with Rocket.Chat's  NodeJS + MongoDB stack - technically, the integration was a breeze! 

TechMeetsTrader will officially launch on January 17 of 2017.   And they have an immediate opening for a talented developer familiar with Rocket.Chat development and customization.  Interested candidates should send their list of recent Rocket.Chat PRs to [jobs@techmeetstrader.com](mailto:jobs@techmeetstrader.com)
