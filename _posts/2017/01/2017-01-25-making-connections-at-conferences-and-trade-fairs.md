With an active community of over 100,000, Rocket.Chat regularly receives global success stories of incredibly innovative use-cases of our open source platform.   Topping the list in 2016 is [Arvato Systems'](https://it.arvato.com) (Germany) Virtual Event Platform.  

### A Coming of age Event Communications Platform

One of the key problems faced by participants at conferences and trade events (both attendees and exhibitors or organizers) is the ability to hook up, interact, and collaborate with relevant contacts - before, during, and after the event.  Limited duration, size/expanse of venue, and the wide variety of distractions all contribute to the difficulty.  Legacy, often non-functional attempts to solve the problem involves an ad-hoc mix of badge scanning, business card exchanges, e-mail, SMS, and personal messenger apps such as WhatsApp.
Arvato Systems' Virtual Event Platform embeds Rocket.Chat at its core, solves the problem by enabling focused/targeted interactive open collaboration and discussions between attending guests, exhibitors, keynote lecturers, and event personnel. 
The platform features:

- Exhibitor channels to discuss their lecture topics and upload company presentations, sharing pictures
- Specialized onboarding channel to inform the attendee public about organizational topics such as up-to-date conference program
- Private channels between logistic personnel, event organizers, exhibitors, and supplier prior and during the event

According to Brian Hampel (System Engineer) and Maria Seidel (Strategy Consultant), a recent deployment of the Virtual Event Platform has been met with great success at a fair operated by their main client.  Participants and organizers were both thrilled to have an interactive platform to facilitate communications and collaboration during the event.

### Deploying Rocket.Chat for Internal Team Collaboration at Arvato Systems

Beyond the Virtual Event Platform, Arvato Systems has also started to use Rocket.Chat as its own internal team messaging and collaboration platform, according to Brian and Maria.   Arvato Systems, a key division of Bertelsmann Group, specializes in IT solutions for Digital Transformation and has over 3,000 staff in 25 locations around the world - including USA and China.  They leverage the technical expertise of its staff to develop IT solutions and smart services that make their clients more agile and more competitive, enabling them to implement innovative business models.  At Arvato Systems Brian and Maria helps to integrate and customize digital workflows that can manage both system operations and system maintenance.

### Rocket.Chat SaaS on OpenStack Private Cloudß

For Arvato Systems' German customers, Maria and Brian plan to offer Rocket.Chat as a customized SaaS collaboration platform, deployed on their managed private OpenStack based cloud platform.  They are currently operating on the latest Mikata Release of OpenStack, according to Brian.
