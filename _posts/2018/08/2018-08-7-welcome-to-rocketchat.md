After Slack announced its acquisition and discontinuation of Atlassian HipChat and Stride, HipChat users have voiced their concerns regarding the lack of self-hosted options for team chat and collaboration, as well as some security concerns linked to Cloud versus on-prem options.

There is strong demand from our user community to accommodate the migration of Atlassian HipChat users to Rocket.Chat. In light of this, Rocket.Chat is offering a special Migration Bundle for HipChat Data Center users looking to migrate to its platform.
<br/>
This Migration Bundle includes:
- [Import](https://rocket.chat/docs/administrator-guides/import/hipchat/) assistance for HipChat Data Center users (a built-in feature in Rocket.Chat)
- Discount on Rocket.Chat for early adopters of our Enterprise Bundle offer (includes Enterprise and Tech Support)

[Contact us](https://rocket.chat/contact) to learn more about the Migration Bundle and how it could work for your team as an alternative to HipChat or a move to Slack. [Visit our dedicated Atlassian page](https://rocket.chat/atlassian) for all the latest on our offering for migrating Atlassian customers.

With Rocket.Chat, communicate and collaborate using team chat and switch to video or audio calls with screen sharing for more efficient teamwork.
Improve productivity by discussing and sharing ideas, projects and files with real-time or asynchronous team chat. Automate daily tasks with multiple bots available including Hubot.

Communicate securely in Rocket.Chatâ€™s workspace thanks to username restriction and admin transparency. Remove bad actors by adding moderators and provide admins with additional controls. None of the latter are possible with Slack.

We offer both [Self-Hosted](https://rocket.chat/install) and [Cloud](https://rocket.chat/cloud) versions of Rocket.Chat as well an Enterprise version that includes the following: free audio and video conferencing, guest access, screen sharing, file sharing, LiveChat, LDAP Group Sync, two-factor authentication (2FA), E2E encryption, SSO, and dozens of OAuth providers. To discuss how Enterprise and its additional features could be a fit for you and your team, [contact us](https://rocket.chat/contact).
