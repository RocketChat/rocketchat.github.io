From distributing just a tarball through to one-click deploys, Rocket.Chat supports more than thirty deployment methods across many on-premise and cloud solutions.

This post covers some of the most popular, easy—and unusual—ways to get started with your own open source team chat!

**1. Ubuntu snap**

Since its release last year, the Rocket.Chat snap has been installed more than 100,000 times, making it the most popular way to deploy Rocket.Chat.

Snaps are safe, secure and fast to deploy; the Rocket.Chat team ran tests that clocked under a minute from command to running the Rocket.Chat server.

You can run a private chat server for as little as $30 with Raspberry
