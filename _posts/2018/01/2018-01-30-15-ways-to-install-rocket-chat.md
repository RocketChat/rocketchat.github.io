From distributing just a tarball through to one-click deploys, Rocket.Chat [supports more than thirty deployment methods](https://rocket.chat/docs/installation/) across many on-premise and cloud solutions.

This post covers some of the most popular, easy—and unusual—ways to get started with your own open source team chat.

**1. Ubuntu snap**

Since its release over a year ago, the Rocket.Chat snap has been installed more than 100,000 times, making it the most popular way to deploy Rocket.Chat.

Snaps are safe, secure and fast to deploy; the Rocket.Chat team ran tests that clocked under a minute from command to running the Rocket.Chat server.

[Install the Rocket.Chat snap](https://rocket.chat/docs/installation/manual-installation/ubuntu/snaps/).

**2. Raspberry Pi**

Run your own private chat server for $30 with Rocket.Chat and Raspberry Pi, the tiny computer that revolutionizsed affordable servers.

Community members are running Rocket.Chat on every model of Pi ever manufactured, including the $5 Pi Zero, meaning you can affordably run your own private social network at home.

**3. Sandstorm**

Sandstorm makes it easy for non-techninal end users to install open source software - without the need to administer their own server.

Popular open source solutions like Rocket.Chat are available in Sandstorm's one-click install App Market.

**4. OpenSUSE**

Although less well-known than some of its Linux distro counterparts (Debian/Ubuntu, for example), openSUSE has a strong following thanks to its stability, active community and the popularity of YaST, openSUSE's installation and configuration tool.

This cloud infrastructure provider is another popular choice through which to deploy Rocket.Chat.
