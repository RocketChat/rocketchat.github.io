## Improved performance

This release is faster and more reliable.

## Improved autocompletion for user mentions

When searching for another user, users who have most recently sent a message appear first. Usernames are filtered by “contains” and not “begins with.”

## More efficient channel creation

Create a new channel and add users to it at the same time.
