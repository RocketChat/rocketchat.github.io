## Blockstack announces $25,000 (USD) bounty for Rocket.Chat integration

Rocket.Chat is collaborating with [Blockstack](https://blockstack.org), the internet for decentralized apps, to build the next-generation messaging platform for cryptocurrency communities. 

The Blockstack Signature Fund is offering a $25,000 USD bounty to the individual or team that successfully integrates [Blockstack's auth system](http://blockstack.github.io/blockstack.js) with Rocket.Chat. 

### Why? 

The Blockstack Signature fund is a $25M fund aimed at building a system of open source applications on Blockstack, including a platform for community-wide communication for open source projects. 

Blockstack's community is currently hosted on Slack but it has become clear that this solution is not suitable for the longer term. 

Several features of a decentralized community like Blockstack's can make it vulnerable to security threats. This is particularly true of phishing attacks, as any user can modify their profile to be identical to that of another user. 

Several other crypto communities [have moved to open source platforms](https://blog.aragon.one/announcing-our-migration-to-an-open-source-messaging-platform-420b25e74284) like Rocket.Chat to protect against these attacks. 

### The challenge
As a result Blockstack is challenging the Rocket.Chat community to build a group messaging application that uses Blockstack auth for login and identity verification. 

This would solve many of the problems associated with Blockstack's existing platforms such as being unable to confirm a user's identity. 

Participants will benefit directly from the expertise of Blockstack fund investors and the Blockstack and Rocket.Chat teams. 

### Take part

Teams and individuals can view full details and register for the bounty [here](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/signature-bounties-community-messaging-app-registration-41319189809?aff=rocket). 

The deadline for the project is **16th February**.
