### A new partnership and integration

Rocket.Chat, the leading on-premises open source communication platform, and Nextcloud, the most popular self-hosted sync, share and collaboration product, announce a new partnership and an integration between their offering.

Over the last few months, engineers at Rocket.Chat and Nextcloud have been collaborating on deep integration of the two solutions, efforts that were first kickstarted by a successful Google Summer of Code project earlier in the year. The integration is now ready and is public from today.

### Seamless integration for simplified collaboration

The integration allows users to post files from Nextcloud directly into a chat channel, enabling seamless integration between chat and file handling. By sharing project documents in a project's chat, collaboration is simplified. Home users can easily share pictures or documents with family and friends. More integrations, that go even further than this latest iteration, are in development.

> "This integration strengthens the strategy that made Nextcloud into the leading on-premises collaboration and communication platform,"

said Frank Karlitschek, CEO and founder at Nextcloud GmbH.

> "As a platform, we aim to provide integration with all relevant products, providing our customers with both choice and flexibility. Rocket.Chat is the perfect addition to Nextcloud and an alternative to Nextcloud Talk."

> "We're glad this integration is available; it's a big step towards creating a comprehensive collaboration ecosystem of open source, decentralised tools,"

said Gabriel Engel, CEO and founder of Rocket.Chat.

> "This is just the beginning, and we are looking forward to hearing from the community about which features we should add to the integration next."

Rocket.Chat and Nextcloud are the perfect combination for those looking for an on-prem, 100% open source, and highly secure collaboration solution.
