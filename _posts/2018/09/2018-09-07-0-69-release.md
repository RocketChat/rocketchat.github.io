### Rocket.Chat Marketplace is live!

We've been working towards having an internal application platform that allows users to extend Rocket.Chat’s functionalities and facilitate customization. With this release we are now ready to launch the first public iteration of our brand new apps ecosystem and our internal marketplace UI for admins.
With Marketplace, you’ll be able to build, browse, and download apps to customize Rocket.Chat More info in our [latest blog post](https://rocket.chat/2018/08/31/marketplace-vision-post/)!

### Beta support for Big Blue Button video conferencing system

[BigBlueButton](https://bigbluebutton.org/) is an open source web conferencing system that we've been working to add as an option for video and voice calls. We are now releasing our first beta implementation that makes it possible to configure your own BBB server and start using it from inside rooms. We are working to increase the integration between Rocket.Chat and BBB for the next release so please try it and let us know your thoughts [here](https://forums.rocket.chat/t/rocket-chat-0-69-released/1962).

### Personal access tokens for users to create API tokens

This feature is disabled by default and only admins can enable it.

Once enabled, users will be able to generate consistent access tokens to be used within the APIs. It's possible to give them names and remove them when necessary. This kind of token does not expire automatically as the normal tokens does.

These tokens can be used in place of the normal auth tokens received when a user logs in via the API, affording security by allowing users to delete the token which revokes access.

### Slackbridge: send attachment notifications

There have been many conversations where the other party didn't realize a screenshot/text file had been uploaded and then the follow up messages had no context. In light of this, we wanted to create notifications to inform users that an attachement had been sent, so now they will see a message that a file was uploaded and can then take action (switch group chat tools) to view it.

Until we have full bi-directional file uploading supported via the SlackBridge, we'll at least post a message so that one knows it occurred.

### UI changes

- The role tag is now lighter

- Unread items are now bolder

### Push notification improvements

We've verified a few issues that were preventing some push notifications from being sent:
- A race condition on the client connection process was indicating a permanently online status for some users, which then meant new notifications for those specific users would not be sent
- Any db connection issue was causing the notifications queue to stop sending notifications

With both these fixes we expect to have fixed the main causes preventing push notifications from being sent.

### Other new features

- REST endpoint to manage server assets
- Rich message text and image buttons

- Setting to enable/disable Slackbridge reactions
- Setting to block unauthenticated access to avatars
- Setting to give users the power to set a JS/CSS CDN

###  Smaller Improvements

- Start storing Livechat department within rooms
- Escape parameters before send them to email template
- Warn about push settings that need server restart
- Role tag UI
- Messagebox fix performance
- Add template tag #{userdn} to filter LDAP group member format (by [crazy-max](https://github.com/crazy-max))
- Add nyan rocket on Rocket.Chat preview Docker image
