LAS VEGAS - Rocket.Chat is now available for instant deployment on the newly launched [AWS Marketplace for Containers](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/features/containers)!

<br/>Customers can henceforth access the AWS Marketplace for Containers to discover, produce, and deploy container solutions such as Rocket.Chat in just a few clicks.  Rocket.Chat containers leverage Amazon Elastic Container Service for Kubernetes (Amazon EKS) to facilitate easy provisioning and management of scaled server clusters.<br/>

Container-based deployments are becoming an increasingly important way for software vendors to package and deploy their applications. They can offer customers substantial cost reduction while gaining enhanced flexibility in cluster configuration when compared to conventional VPS or VM-based deployments. Rocket.Chat is thrilled to be able to offer the latest server deployment and provisioning solution, in conjunction with Amazon, to its customers.

>"Launching with AWS at re:Invent is really exciting for us. We loved the opportunity to work with the AWS team to create these containers. They will provide our enterprise customers with a cost effective open source collaboration solution that will help them unchain from Slack and Microsoft Teams and take back control of their data,"

affirms Rocket.Chat CEO Gabriel Engel.

## About Rocket.Chat

[Rocket.Chat](https://rocket.chat) is an open source team chat collaboration platform that allows users to communicate securely in real-time on web, desktop or mobile and to customize their interface with a range of plugins, themes and integrations with other key software. Users can set up Rocket.Chat on cloud or by hosting their own servers on-premises, and the platform can be installed on Linux, FreeBSD, macOS and Windows as well as on Android and iOS. <br/>[Rocket.Chat Marketplace](https://rocket.chat/marketplace) launched in September 2018, enabling users to build, browse and download apps on Rocket.Chat’s newest app ecosystem.<br/>By opting for Rocket.Chat, users also benefit from audio and video conferencing, guest access, screen and file sharing, LiveChat, LDAP Group Sync, two-factor authentication (2FA), E2E encryption, SSO, dozens of OAuth providers and unlimited users, guests, channels, messages, searches and files.

Architecturally, the Rocket.Chat server is a middle tier process and, more specifically, a Node.js process running on Linux. It accepts requests from clients (mobile iOS or Android apps, desktop client, web client, and so on…) and executes them. Data persistence is achieved through a MongoDB server at the database tier.
Rocket.Chat can be scaled by increasing the number of middle tier server instances working on incoming requests, all sharing the same database instance. In this case, MongoDB acts as both data persistence as well as real-time state synchronizer between the Rocket.Chat server instances.

With more than 800 developer-contributors on Github, Rocket.Chat has the largest and most active community of chat developers in the open source communication sector and has won multiple awards since being founded in 2015, such as a 2016 Bossie Award for Best Open Source Application and first prize in the 2017 edition of All Things Open’s Startup Competition.
