 Thank you for your great work on testing the app and creating pull requests.


## Edit and delete a message

<div class="left copy">
<p>
You can now press down on a message to edit it. Users will be able to edit their own messages or at least do so within a limited window, depending on server settings.
</p>
<p>
To delete a message, press down on it. This action will result in either permanent deletion or the message will be deleted but retained on the server. Deletion type is dependent on server settings.
</p>

  </p>
</div>
<div class="clear"></div>

## Autocomplete of emojis

<div class="left copy">
<p>
In your text field, type `:` and the first letters of the emoji you want, and the app will show you the related emojis as you type. All  matching emojis are always shown, so that when users type `:ro` the `:rocket:` ðŸš€ emoji will be shown and so will the `:broccoli` ðŸ¥¦ emoji.

<div class="clear"></div>

## Support all authentication methods

Following several requests from the community, you can now connect to Rocket.Chat using any of the authentication methods that are supported on the web, such as GitHub, Facebook, LinkedIn, CAS and SAML. Custom OAuth support has also been improved.

## Deeplink support

The iOS app now supports deeplink integration with the ability to connect to a new server and open a chat directly from a link. Read more about this <a target="_blank" href="https://rocket.chat/docs/developer-guides/deeplink/">here</a>

## Change the icon of the app

You can now choose a different color for the icon on your home screen. More colors will be added in future releases.
If you have any suggestion of colors/styles, send us the artwork or [open an issue](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat.iOS/issues) in our GitHub repository.
