Kansas State University is a public research univeristy in the U.S. state of Kansas. Basketball was founded there in 1898. The scientist who who discovered vitamins A and D was a graduate, and helium was extracted from gas for the first time in a Kansus State University lab.

Today the university is home to more than 28,000 students and an active self-hosted instance of Rocket.Chat which is used by the university's Information Technology Services (ITS) team to collaborate in real-time.

Since its implementation 18 months ago Rocket.Chat has become the team's primary communication tool with 375 users, 34,000 messages sent and 77 channels and 99 private groups created in that time.

## Trying out chat solutions

The team used Openfire before switching to Rocket.Chat but it lacked some basic functionality, like syncing conversations when a user switched device. This created problems with data organization and led to disconnected conversations between team members.

Over the course of three years the team trialled several different team chat solutions including HipChat and Slack but found the same issue each time: the free version of these softwares was too limited but the paid version was financially unviable for this team of more than 300 members.

## The team hears about Rocket.Chat

The team knew that they wanted a self-hosted, customizable open source solution when they heard about Rocket.Chat through DigitalOcean.

Setup was quick and straightforward and Rocket.Chat was vetted by staff inside and outside the IT department. The university held an open comment period in spring 2016, after which Rocket.Chat was approved by ITS leadership to be the single chat application for the department.

## Rolling out Rocket.Chat

Although the initial response to Rocket.Chat was positive, the team created a training video and website to explain how to use Rocket.Chat and ran an initial training session to encourage uptake.

18 months later, Rocket.Chat is the number-one communication tool within the ITS and the platform's LiveChat function is used to provide assistance to students and colleagues outside of the department.

In that time the department has heavily customized their Rocket.Chat and added new protocols and options for users in Mac, Windows and Linux.

As Greg Dressman, Information Systems Supervisor at the university explains: “[Rocket.Chat] is open to all student employees and employees in Information Technology as the LiveChat solution. We already had another tool on campus, but we needed a better solution, an IT solution. We went from disconnected conversations to a centralized place that can be accessed from different interfaces and it's all synchronized.”
