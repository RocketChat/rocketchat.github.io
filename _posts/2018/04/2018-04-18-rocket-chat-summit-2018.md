In March this year, Rocket.Chat’s 40-strong team and significant others
travelled to Bonito in Brazil’s Mato Grosso do Sul for its 2018 Summit for
a week-long adventure that was filled with incredible activities, company-wide
meetings and, most importantly, the chance to spend time together.

## Meaningful Encounters

As a company with remote teams located worldwide, our Summit was a crucial opportunity
for us all to meet face to face, often for the first time, and get to know what makes each other tick.

Team members were able to hang out while trekking through lush forest and swimming in the scenic Estância
Mimosa waterfalls, discovering caves, and exploring the Pantanal on a wildlife safari and piranha-fishing trip!

Those who raft and snorkel together, stay together!

## Meetings and team challenges

During the Summit, we also made time for meetings, presentations, brainstorming sessions and team challenges
that helped us to begin shaping our company values, vision and goals.

We talked, debated, and thought about where we want to be in 2 as well as in 5 years’ time,
and what we have to act upon now in order to enable that roadmap.
Gabriel gave a presentation on how Rocket.Chat came to be, which was very insightful for staff new and old.

Rocket.Chat also tackled the Marshmallow Challenge, which tests how various teams of four face the tough task
of having 18 minutes to build the tallest free-standing structure out of 20 sticks of spaghetti, one yard of tape,
one yard of string, and one marshmallow. We mixed participants from different Rocket.Chat departments to ensure that skills
and talents were evenly balanced before getting stuck into the challenge with enthusiasm and lots of concentration! As well as being fun,
the challenge gave us insight into how we work collectively when faced with a problem and reminded us of the importance of testing as we work
rather than over-plan and end up with issues.
