Rocket.Chat and [Gluu](https://www.gluu.org/) jointly announce an extensive partnership today to collaborate on identity and access management (IAM) and strong authentication for community, enterprise, and institutional customers.

In accordance with this partnership, Rocket.Chat will work with Gluu to identify and support best practices for single sign-on (SSO), two-factor authentication (2FA), user enrollment, and access management in its industry-leading messaging platform. Gluu will in turn offer Rocket.Chat as an open source team collaboration and LiveChat platform to its clients.

> "We are delighted to work with the amazing team at Gluu to offer our community and customers a robust, industry proven solution for single sign-on (SSO) and two-factor authentication (2FA),"

said  Gabriel Engel, CEO of Rocket.Chat.

Rocket.Chat supports OAuth 2.0 out-of-the-box and can quickly be configured to use an Authorization Server (AS) like Gluu for user sign
in. By leveraging open web standards like OAuth, OpenID Connect, and FIDO, organizations can significantly improve account security and
reduce the likelihood of password-related hacking incidents.

> "Rocket.Chat is the premier open source solution for team communication and the platform of choice at Gluu,"

said Gluu CEO Michael Schwartz.

> "We are excited to work with the Rocket.Chat team to offer organizations around the world a secure and scalable solution for team collaboration and identity and access management,"

added Schwartz.
