      <h3>Easy</h3>
      <p>
        Rocket.Chat Cloud is the easiest way to install, setup and manage Rocket.Chat.
        It requires no technical knowledge and you can start a trial in a couple of minutes, no credit card required.
      </p>
      <h3>Affordable</h3>
      <p>
        We believe in charging a fair rate for the resources you need rather than for every team member or guest,
        giving you an affordable and scalable team chat solution for tens of thousands of users.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="right">
      <h3>Scalable</h3>
      <p>
        Rocket.Chat's robust and scalable Cloud, built on Docker and Kubernetes,
        gives you the benefits of an open source communication platform
        without having to manage and scale your own infrastructure and support team.
      </p>
      <h3>Secure</h3>
      <p>
        Every cloud instance runs in it's own secure isolated environment which we monitor 24x7.
        Your data is backed-up up to every hour, to give you peace of mind in the case of an emergency.

        We were looking for a tool that facilitates team and cross department
        communication. It was a pleasant surprise when we discovered Rocket.Chat
        and everything it offers, especially the ease of integration with other
        products and tools.
