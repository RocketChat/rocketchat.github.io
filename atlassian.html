After Slack announced its acquisition and discontinuation of Atlassian HipChat and Stride, HipChat users have voiced  their concerns regarding the lack of self-hosted options for team chat and collaboration, as well as some security concerns linked to Cloud versus on-prem options.

There is strong demand from our user community to accommodate the migration of Atlassian HipChat users to Rocket.Chat.  In light of this, Rocket.Chat is offering  a special Migration Bundle for HipChat Data Center users looking to migrate to its platform.
<br/>
This Migration Bundle includes:
- Import assistance for HipChat Data Center users (a built-in feature in Rocket.Chat)
- Discount on Rocket.Chat for early adopters of our Enterprise Bundle offer (includes Enterprise and Tech Support)

[Contact us](https://rocket.chat/contact) to learn more about the Migration Bundle and how it could work for your team as an alternative to HipChat or a move to Slack.
