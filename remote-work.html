                    <p class="theme_type--light">Coronavirus is affecting workplaces worldwide. There is still much we don’t know about this epidemic, for how long it will last, how it will affect the population and the economy.  There are numerous practices that can help to contain the virus and prevent it from spreading, and at this time it's important that each individual put their social responsibility as a priority. </p>
                    <p class="theme_type--light">The epidemic itself was not something we could predict, but side actions, such as remote work, can help business to keep productive. Rocket.Chat is committed to improving team collaboration and omnichannel communication. It is a great tool to keep track of projects and discussions with stakeholders without losing security, flexibility, and scalability.</p>
                    <p class="theme_type--light">We are currently one of the most accessible communication tools in the market and at this time of uncertainty, we are committed to supporting you and your team even further. From March 17th and beyond we will host webinars on how to work remotely with Rocket.Chat on a weekly basis.</p>
