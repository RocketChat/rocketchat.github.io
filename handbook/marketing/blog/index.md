# Rocket.Chat blog

Our [blog](https://rocket.chat/blog/) is managed by the marketing team. Other team members are encouraged to contribute blog posts, but please consult the [publishing process](#publishing-process) section beforehand.

## Objectives and purposes

The core purposes of the blog are as follows:

- Use the blog to encourage potential users to try Rocket.Chat
- Promote Rocket.Chat's active community of contributors
- Communicate the benefits of Rocket.Chat's features
- Talk about the experiences of the Rocket.Chat team and users

## What content should go on the blog?

Longer form content on what we have done or what we are doing. This can include:

- User case studies
- Release notes (all platforms)
- Open source news (with specific mention of Rocket.Chat)
- Announcing a new partnership or affilication

## Publishing processes and guidelines

The marketing team will make the final decision on what content is published on the blog.

The following two sections outline the processes for both requesting blog posts from the marketing team and for proposing and writing your own content to submitted to the Rocket.Chat blog.

### **Requesting blog posts from the marketing team**

### Proposing a blog post

Any team member is free to suggest a topic for a blog post to the marketing team.

Before making a post request, please consider the following:
-  Does this post fit into one of the following core areas?
    - **Product** -  for example, a release post or a longer-form discussion of a feature or integration
   - **Company culture** - for example, Rocket.Chat's open source values and distributed team
   - **Community** - for example, a featured contributor
   - **Company case study** - how has Rocket.Chat improved the way this organization communicates and shares ideas?

- How relevant is this topic to our core values and community?

  - Is this a high-profile company or an organization doing interesting things? A _lot_ of communities and organizations use Rocket.Chat and it would be impossible to write about them all, so please aim to be selective with your proposed topic.
  - What kind of coverage has your proposed sector already received and how can your proposed topic be linked to wider industry trends

### Making a blog post request

Once you're sure your proposed topic meets the above guidelines, then please make your blog request by doing the following:

1. Check the **Marketing** board in Asana to see what the team's publishing schedule already looks like.
1. Email or message Sean on Rocket.Chat with your proposed topic. Please remember to include the following:
  - Proposed topic and a short explanation of why you feel this post will be interesting or beneficial to our readers
  - Proposed word count
  - Deadline (not all content is time-sensitive so some deadlines may be more stringent than others)
  - Will we need to conduct an interview in order to write the post? If the answer is 'yes,' please provide:
    - Interviewee's name and contact details so that a member of the marketing team can reach out to them
    - Whether yourself or another member of the Rocket.Chat team has previously been in contact with the interviewee

    **NB**. Please make sure that a blog post topic has been approved before contacting potential interviewees. This is to avoid any confusion or disappointment should the marketing team decide to not write or publish a post.

3. Sean will send feedback on your blog proposal.
1. If the topic is a good fit for the blog, then please allow two weeks for your post to be written, edited and published!
