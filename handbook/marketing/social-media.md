# Social media

## Social channels

Rocket.Chat has accounts on the following platforms:

- [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/RocketChatApp/)
- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/rocketchat?lang=en)
- [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/rocket-chat/)
- [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/rocket.chat/)

## Content

- Currently, content shared to Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn is not differentiated by platform.
    * The tone for these platforms is professional but conversational.
    * Target audience is the Rocket.Chat community.
    * Content is focused on Rocket.Chat in the news, user guides/ documentation, posts from the Rocket.Chat blog or third-party blogs that mention Rocket.Chat
    * [Mention.com](http://mention.com) is a useful site for content curation.
- Instagram is used less frequently and is focused on promoting Rocket.Chat attendance at events and company culture.

## Goals

- At least two social updates per day.
    * Retweet/like positive mentions of Rocket.Chat on an ad-hoc basis.
- Generate at least two pieces of original content to share on social media per week.
- Content to be shared in English and Brazilian Portuguese.

## Scheduling

### Timetable

- Social posts are scheduled for Monday to Friday, not on the weekends.
- Posts are scheduled and published at GMT - 2 (America/ Sao Paulo).
- Post one update in the AM and one in the PM between 9:00AM and 6:00PM.

### Process

- Shorten URLs in [Google URL Shortener](https://goo.gl). This is for tracking purposes. Ensure that you are signed in with your Rocket.Chat account when using this tool in order to keep all of your links in one place.
    * If you choose to not use a link, ensure that you archive it.
- Schedule posts in [Hootsuite](https://hootsuite.com/dashboard) the week before they are due to be published.
- Record your scheduled posts in the [Social Media Schedule](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qIVBC0fUMCBfzRJK2TQA5K0m_gWZc5rNnPsGemZSUxE/edit?usp=sharing) so that they can be approved ahead of being published.
- At the end of each month, record which URLs gained the highest number of impressions, clicks and engagement in the Social Media Schedule.
