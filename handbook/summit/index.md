# Summit

## What, Where, and When

Rocket.Chat holds a yearly summit to gather its teams, get face time, build links, and work together. It also enable us to welcome in person new members who may have joined the team since the previous Summit.

## Goals

The Summit is a great way for all staff to get to know each other and to build closer ties between different teams.

Attending the summit is optional but highly recommended as they are key to our remote teams connecting in person.

Use the Summit as an opportunity to meet members of other teams. This allows for a greater understanding of what the various Rocket.Chat teams do, what their projects are and how they work.
