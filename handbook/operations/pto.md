# Paid-Time-Off (PTO) Policy

*Last updated: 22 December 2017*

Rocket.Chat encourages everyone to take some time off whenever you need it, be it for visiting exotic places or just taking some time for yourself. This is important for maintaining a healthy work/life balance.

## PTO Guide

1. You may take as many days off as you want, as long as your work is organised and in order, i.e. that your work or responsibilities are not compromised by your absence.
2. We enforce a minimum of 20 days of vacation per year. This is not a benefit; this is our requirement for maintaining the team's health.
3. When you decide which days you want to take off, please request them in [BambooHR](https://rocketchat.bamboohr.com) so that everyone knows you will be away during that period.
4. For every period you decide to take off, you must request it no fewer than twice as many business days plus one. For example, assuming someone wants leave from June 4, 2018 until June 15, 2018 they would have to request PTO on or before May 4, 2018 (21 business days before) as this is a total of 10 business days.  Exceptions are listed on Types of Time Off, below.
5. You are free to take some time off to go to the gym, go grocery shopping, take a nap, do household chores, help someone, etc. If something comes up or takes longer than expected, you have urgent tasks and you're able to communicate, just ensure the rest of the team knows and someone can pick up any of your urgent tasks.
6. Being part of a global onsite/remote team means you need to be highly organized and a considerate team player. Each team has busy times so it is always a good idea to check with them to ensure there is adequate coverage in place.
7. Don't forget to always check with your line manager and/or project manager before requesting time off. This is to ensure no deadlines are being overseen and to provide them with enough time to accommodate resources.

## Types of Time Off

1. **Casual**: days you'd like to take off, but in case of emergency you may be contacted
2. **Vacation**: days you would not like to be contacted by any means
3. **Sick**: this is an exception to the rule concerning the number of days you need to request before leave ;D Whenever you're sick, please add that day as a sick day type of time off
4. **Half-day**: for when you know you'll be available during half of the day only
5. **Maternity**: duh, paternity as well :)

## Recognizing Burnout

It is important for us to take a step back in order to recognize and acknowledge the feelings of being "burned out". We are not as effective or efficient when we work long hours, miss meals or forego nurturing our personal lives for sustained periods of time. If you feel yourself or notice someone on your team experiencing burnout, be sure to address it right away. To get ahead of a problem, be sure to communicate with the COO and/or CEO if the following statement ever applies to you, "I'm feeling like I might burn out if the situation doesn't change."


If you or your peers are showing signs of burnout, you should take time out to focus on things that relax you and improve your overall health and welfare. We as a team should address burnout right away by discussing options with each other to evaluate the workload and manage contributing stressors.


Other tips to avoid burnout include:

- Assess and pursue your interests, skills and passions
- Take breaks during the day to eat healthy foods
- Make time each day to increase blood and oxygen circulation which improves brain
activity and functionality
- Get plenty of restful sleep

## Statutory Vacation Requirements

### Brasil Employees

Employees must take at least 30 vacation days. The days will accrue yearly starting 1 year after contract start date. If employees have not taken 30 days off before the work year ends they will be required to take the remainder of their 30 days off. There is no carry-over for unused vacation days.

### US Employees

The U.S. Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) does not require payment for time not worked such as vacations, sick leave or federal or other holidays, but employees are eligible for our Unlimited Time Off Policy.

### Worldwide Contractors

Contractors do not have statutory vacation requirements, but are eligible for our Unlimited Time Off Policy.
