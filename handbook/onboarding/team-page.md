# Rocket.Chat team page

The [Rocket.Chat team page](https://rocket.chat/team) is where you can find information on who works at Rocket.Chat!

Each team member is featured with their job title, professional photo and link to their GitHub profile (if appropriate).

Those first to join Rocket.Chat appear at the top of the page, with new team members being added to the bottom of the page as they join.

It is each team member's responsibility to add their own information and photo to the page once they join. The below section shows you how to do this.

## Adding your information to the team page

1. Open [Visual Studio](https://code.visualstudio.com).
2. Open the Rocket.Chat repository. If you have not already cloned the Rocket.Chat repository to your device, there is a guide on how to do this in the handbook under Marketing > Blog > [Creating a blog post](https://rocketchat.github.io/handbook/marketing/blog/posting/).
3. Open **team.yml**.
4. The following fields need to be filled in by all team members:
