# Meetings

## Scheduling meetings

1. If you want to schedule a meeting with a team member, first check their personal Google Calendar to ensure your proposed time and date does not clash with an existing commitment.
2. Send a calendar invite from and to the company address. This makes it easier for people to check availability.
3. Click 'Guests can modify event' so people can modify the time in the calendar instead of having to reach out.
4. We recommend either [Google Hangouts](https://hangouts.google.com/) or [Jitsi](https://jitsi.org/jitsi-videobridge/), which is already integrated with Rocket.Chat.
5. For meetings with external guests [appear.in](https://appear.in) is ideal as the other person will not need to register or download software.

## Regular Rocket.Chat group meetings

We have two types of regular meeting at Rocket.Chat, as described below:

## Weekly team call

Once a week the whole team joins a call to discuss what they have been working on that week. There is a Q&A session at the end where team members can ask about any area of the business.

Team call schedule:
- Begins at 16:00 (GMT)
- Duration is currently half an hour but this may be increased as the team grows

1. Attendance of the team call is compulsory.
2. Please come prepared to discuss what you have been working on that week.

## Roadmap discussion

On the first Friday of each month the team holds a high-level visual summary that maps out the direction of the product over the next few months.

Roadmap discussion schedule:
- Begins at 16:30 (GMT)
- Duration is one hour

1. Attendance is recommended but not compulsory.
2. The roadmap discussion follows on from the team call and is continued in the same Google Hangouts chatroom.

Both meetings take place in [Google Hangouts](https://hangouts.google.com). Team members will receive a link to the meeting both via email and in their Google Calendar as a recurring event.

Ensure your microphone is muted unless you are speaking.
